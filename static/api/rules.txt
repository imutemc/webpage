---- Griefing ----
1: Training, or angering hostile mobs to chase you at another player. This is named because the chain of mobs looks like a train.
2: Camping, or killing a player, then killing them again at their point of death or the spawn.
3: PVP stalking, or stalking a player and continuing to kill them. This is similar to camping, but occurs with the same player for a long period of time.
4: Chat spamming, or adding random text or profanity into the chat.
5: Walls. Self-explanatory, but must be constructed out of a high-level material that cannot be easily destroyed. This is also used to defend against griefers.
6: Encasement in walls. Normal walls, but surrounding a player so s/he can't get out.
7: Sniping. This is normally not griefing, but is a form of the PVP stalker.
8: Destroying Structures built by other players without their explicit permission.
